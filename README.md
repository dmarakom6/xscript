# xscript
A tiny language

**Don't** imitate this, It's too easy!!!

I don't like to add comments, so would you help me?

# How does it work?
[Click here!](howto.md)

# How to run code?
Type `xscript.py *.xs` to run xscript file.

## Debug your code
Change `xscript.py` line 19 to
```python
interpreter = core.XScriptInterpreter(source, debug=True)
```

# How fast is it?
Like lightning! No, no, it's a lie. Just a bit slow.

We use a little program to calculate it, you can find it in `script/circle.xs`.
You can run it by yourself.

Also, you can read `debug.txt` for debug detail.
