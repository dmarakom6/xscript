# Script
This folder has some example of xscript language.

| File         | What to do                 |
| :----------- | :------------------------- |
| circle.xs    | Draw a circle with turtle  |
| hello.xs     | Puts string user input     |
| hello-gui.xs | Create window with a label |
| win.xs       | Create a window            |

## Note
`script/hello-gui.xs` has a bug in `xscript.ui.Label` that I don't know how to debug it, so don't run it.
